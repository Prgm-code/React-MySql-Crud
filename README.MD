CRUD Application with React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, Express, and MySQL
This is a simple CRUD application that uses the following technologies:

React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Vite: A fast and efficient web app compiler.
Tailwind CSS: A low-level CSS framework that allows for highly customizable and responsive user interfaces.
Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment based on Chrome's V8 engine.
Express: A Node.js web application framework for building web apps and RESTful APIs.
MySQL: An open-source relational database management system.
The application allows users to perform the following actions:

Create a new record in the database.
Read all existing records in the database.
Update an existing record in the database.
Delete an existing record in the database.
The application consists of a user interface built with React and Tailwind CSS, and a RESTful API built with Node.js and Express. The MySQL database is used to store and retrieve data for the application.
